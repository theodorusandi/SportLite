This app provides a content filtering solution for YouTube, allowing users to watch only highlights. The app uses a MutationObserver to dynamically monitor and update the feed, ensuring that newly loaded content is also filtered according to the user's preferences. This enhances the user experience by automatically curating the feed to focus on specific content.
